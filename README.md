## Sequence-to-sequence Learning of Financial Time Series in Algorithmic Trading

*more info to come later*

## Compiling the document

Run `python make.py` in the project root directory. If you intend to work continuously on the thesis, run `python make.py watch` to have [pymake2](https://github.com/philiparvidsson/pymake2) automatically recompile the document when a change has been detected.

## Delimitations:
- We will not be writing the source code for the neural networks. Instead, we will use scikit-learn and TensorFlow
- We will only use FOREX data as source for financial data (other sources do not provide real-time data)
- The problem will be treated as a classificatiom problem rather than a regression problem (maybe)
