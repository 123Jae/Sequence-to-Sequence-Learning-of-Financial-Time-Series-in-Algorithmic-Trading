    Time series forecasting---predicting future values of variables within a domain---is a largely unsolved problem in complex or chaotic domains such as weather (e.g. humidity, temperature or wind speed) and economics (e.g. currency exchange rates or stock prices). \textsc{lstm}-based (\textsc{l}ong \textsc{s}hort-\textsc{t}erm \textsc{m}emory) \textsc{rnn}s (\textsc{r}ecurrent \textsc{n}eural \textsc{n}etworks) are powerful models that have recently been applied with success to predict future time series sequences from historical, sequential datasets; such as predicting the weather for the next twenty-four hours, or predicting the next sequence of words in natural language. In this paper, we will attempt to investigate the problem by applying \textsc{lstm}-based \textsc{rnn}s, something that has not been done before.\\
