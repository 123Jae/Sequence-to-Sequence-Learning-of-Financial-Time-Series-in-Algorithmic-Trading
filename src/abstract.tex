    Predicting the behavior of financial markets is largely an unsolved
    problem.  The problem has been approached with many different methods
    ranging from binary logic, statistical calculations and genetic algorithms.
    In this thesis, the problem is approached with a machine learning method,
    namely the Long Short-Term Memory (\textsc{lstm}) variant of Recurrent
    Neural Networks (\textsc{rnn}s).  Recurrent neural networks are artificial
    neural networks (\textsc{ann}s)---a machine learning algorithm mimicking the
    neural processing of the mammalian nervous system---specifically designed
    for time series sequences.  The thesis investigates the capability of the
    \textsc{lstm} in modeling financial market behavior as well as compare it to
    the traditional \textsc{rnn}, evaluating their performances using various
    measures.
